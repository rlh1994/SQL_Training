---------------Exercise 5-------------------------------
/*
Create queries that answer the below questions using the tools you have learnt so far (some questions take more than 1 query!)
1) How many (and which) customers are paying a different amount on their monthly bill than they should for their product?
Bonus: how many are paying more, how many are paying less, what the average overpayment and underpayment, which do we care more about as a company?
2) How many customers have incorrect data regarding end date/continued billing, and what are the errors?
3) Rewrite the above query using the new availability table (you will need to lookup the replace function) - which customers are served by a product they don't have available?

Putting it all together! The final Mirgin Vedia exercise
We want to advertise to all our customers who could be on a faster product than they are currently on, there are a few things we will want to know:
(make sure to exclude any issue customers you found before! Remember you can use a not in (maybe create a table with those order numbers in?))
	a) Who are these customers? How many are there?
	b) How much could their personal speed improve, and what's the average speed all these customers could see an uplift of?
	c) How much more would these customers be paying personally? How much more would the company make from this? 
	d) Say we wanted to entice customers by offering them money off their bill, do we make more money by offering 10% or Â£10 regardless of new bill amount?
	e) We want to build a table that we can use to send all our emails from to these customers automatically. 
	Write a query that returns 2 columns - one with customer email and one with the content of the email using the concatination operator we learnt earlier
	Use the below template, create a table in your schema first with each of these options (or whatever you need to get them easily) and then write the final script and query that table


Dear  _______, We noticed that you are currently on our _____ product with an upload/download speed of ___mbps/___mbps, but you could be getting ___mbps/___mbps by switching to our _____ product. Not only will this let you stream all your favourite shows and download all your new music faster than ever, but for a limited time rather than the usual cost of Â£___ we are offering this to you for Â£____ (use whichever makes the company more money from above), meaning this is only Â£___ more than your current bill! That is a bargain you will only get direct from Mirgin Vedia. If you want to know more give our friendly customer helper line a call on 0800 GO-VEDIA (0800 46 83342)! Thanks, Your Local Mirgin Vedia Team!


The lack of formatting might make our campaign less successful, but at least we don't have to type them all by hand!
