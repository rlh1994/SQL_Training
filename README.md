# SQL_Training
The files here are used in the setup and running of a self-designed Oracle SQL training session. All the data is randomly generated. The data is designed to be that of a new company selling phone and broadband services, Mirgin Vedia, and the tables are set up as example data such a company might have. The training is designed for those with little to no SQL experience so does not cover more complex topics.

# Setup and usage
You will need to replace all instances of "SCHEMA_NAME" across all files with the name of the schema you wish to create the tables in and query them from. The answers to exercises are provided as a guidance and as such there may be better or other ways to answer these questions.

Feel free to use the data and training material as you want, but where relevant credit me.
