# SQL_Training
The files here are used in the setup and running of a self-designed Oracle SQL training session. The data is based off the R package nycflights13 but has been convereted into a format for upload into an Oracle SQL database. The introduction training is designed, with the support from the slides (hosted at https://rlh1994.github.io/SQL_Training/ ) for users with no experience at all to take them to being able to write the majority of queries they will need. The focus is on being able to work with and access data already in a database, rather than on database management via PL/SQL.

# Setup and usage
You will need to replace all instances of "SCHEMA_NAME" across all files with the name of the schema you wish to create the tables in and query them from. The answers to exercises are provided as a guidance and as such there may be better or other ways to answer these questions.

Feel free to use the data and training material as you want, but where relevant credit me.
